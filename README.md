# Madjy E-commerce 
Create a [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) front-end for a simple e-commerce website named Madjy.  

## How to use the Scripts
Suppose you have already installed the npm command:
- run the following commands 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/djibybalde/madjy-ecommerce.git  # to download scripts from GitHub
cd madjy-ecommerce  
npm install  # to install all dependencies
```
- you can add your own STRIPE KEY in the `.env` file (create this .env file in the root directory) with REACT_APP_STRIPEKEY for the paiement, no required. 

- you can use `yarn start` to run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
